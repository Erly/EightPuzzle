Eight Puzzle
=======

Android version of the famous 8-puzzle sliding puzzle (also known a 9-puzzle, 15-puzzle and 16-puzzle). It consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing and the object of the game is to order the tiles making sliding moves that use the empty space. The first version will allow to load any image form the android phone and divide it in 9 tiles (8-puzzle version) and with a future update it will allow the user to divide the image in 16 tiles (15-puzzle). Online rankings, puzzle sincronization and puzzle of the day are also planned for future updates, but the first version will be very simple and allow only to resolve puzzles made with images loaded from the phone.
